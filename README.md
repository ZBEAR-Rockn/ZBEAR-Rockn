ğŸ‘‹Use of this tool:

ğŸ“« Description Viewpoint A : Public service performance style

The mesh part which is confused by the various cases and operates is registered as the new vertex group and all vertices in the registered vertex group are liberated from all interference by the unknown several bones. This new vertex group's weights will be reset by the weight value given your inputted float value for an additional specified bone. This simplifies the complex situation affected by various bones. This simplifies the indiscriminate weighting of a vertices part caused by automatic weight paint, and helps to keep the work going by making the weighting situation of irregular mesh simple again without backing down from the middle point of the work.

- UI No. 0: There must be an active object in selection, and its name must be on UI.
- UI No. 1: Collect the Vertices that have been interfered with and lost their way for all of armature's Bones, designate them as the new Vertex Group and prepare new name for this Group.
- UI No. 2: Enter the name of the new vertex group above.
- UI No. 3: Decide one bone to be attached on your New Vertex Group (if the weighting states of this vertex group are already nice, that vertices in that group's will return to the position of their non-weighted original local location).
- UI No. 4: Enter the name of the bone you picked from above.
- UI No. 5: Enter the weight value to decide how much the Vertex Group will be affected by the Bone entered by you
- UI No. 6: Check all parts and click this button if there is no logical flaw.


ğŸ“« Description Viewpoint B :  Casual style


- This tool can be used at more proper situation through the way of resetting partial weight to 0 and giving weights only to one of the most relevant bones. It would be better than keep your working state in the following situations :

- Specially, in case of the mesh which is skinned with all kinds of the automatic weighting techniques, the weighting result is partly very complicatedly twisted and it shows the undesirable deforming shapes in the pose change

- Use as an assistant tool of weighting solution when it's  needed to correct accidental weighting twisting by various automatic weighting techniques

- When the weights of the vertices blocked from the view were painted weirdly by multiple bones, and even this situation was accumulated, and UNDO function is no more helpful to recover, or you feel like the one more UNDO can shutting down the Blender

- When using weight painting mode and even if you still clicking Ctrl + LMB on each bones for more than 40 minutes but there is no better

- Even doing one more action with Ctrl + Bone clicking is disgustingly tired and mentally painful
